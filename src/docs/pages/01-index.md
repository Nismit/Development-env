title: Components Styleguide 
---

In personal CSS/SASS style guide in 2018, It will be updated constantly.
It is influenced by [BEM](https://en.bem.info/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [FLOCSS](https://github.com/hiloki/flocss)

## Objective

Due to the fact that CSS files have been bigger and bigger, maintainig or expanding is harder.
Eventually a new selector will be added over and over. To avoid this fact, I made this style guide for CSS/SASS development.

- Consistency
- Maintainable
- Readable
- DRY
- KISS
